  <h2> CSS </h2>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong></a></p>
  <p>is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document</p>
  <p>written in a markup language such as</p>
  <p>HTML.[1] CSSis a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,</p>
  <p>alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]</p>

  <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.</p>
  <p>[3]This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification </p>
  <p>of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate </p>
  <p>to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
  <p>.css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached </p>

  <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page</p>
  <p>in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen,</p>
  <p>in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),</p>
  <p>and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting</p>
  <p>if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]</p>

  <p>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style </p>
  <p>rule applies if more than one rule matches a</p>
  <p>particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p>

  <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>
  <p>Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998).</p>
  <p>The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]</p>
  <p>In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p>
