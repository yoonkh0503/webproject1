<h2>Javascript</h2>
  <p><a href = "https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/introduction/ECMA-and-javascript.php">JavaScript</a> [8] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript</p>
  <p>specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.</p>
  <p>It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>

  <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.</p>
  <p>[10] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,</p>
  <p>[11] often incorporating third-party libraries.</p>
  <p>[12] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.</p>

  <p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.</p>
  <p>It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,</p>
  <p>and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>

  <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.</p>
  <p>In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p>

  <p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems,</p>
  <p>most notably servers and a variety of applications.</p>
